## Difference between the present and the past with respect to  number of interfaces, functional interfaces and performance interfaces?

The past: only two layers, hardware and application layers.
Both the hardware and application layers were documented in details and all the documentation were available. 

The present: there are several layers, 6 layers: hardware, virtual machine, operating system, virtual machine, framework & middleware and application. In this case the functional interfaces documentation is available but we are not aware of the performance interfaces. 

For instance, in the past we have access of the specific number of cycles required for each instruction in the documentation of the processor, nowdays the performance, specifically for low level layers are unknown or not publicly availabe.

"The real problem is that programmers have spent far too mch time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and a t the wrong times;

premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming." - Donald Knuth

# Comparison between "Algorithmic Complexity" and "Performance"

The cost function considered in algorithmic complexity is not interesing in our case. We have a problem size in the case of algorithmic complexity, we are not interested describing the performance in a condition with the high problem size. In performance analysis we are interesting in identifying implementation bottlenecks when problem size is small.

# Relative and absolute essence

N_m is the number of methods present in the program
N_l is the number of loops present in the program

In the basic case, without recursion, we identify two mesures:

 - The absolute essence: E(N_l) = N_l
 - The relative essence: e(N_l, N_m) = N_l / N_m 

In case of recursive methods we have additional definitions:

N_n is the number of non-recursive methods
N_r is the number of recursive methods
N_l remains the number of loops

The absolute essence is equal to the sum between the number of loops and the number of recursive calls:

E = N_l + N_r

The relative essence in this case is:

e = (N_l + N_r) / (N_n + N_r)
